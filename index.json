[{"categories":["Travel Gear"],"contents":" As more adventurers hit the road for traveling, the more options we have for luggage. Travel backpacks are the best option for frequent travel abroad. From the weekend warrior to the long-term nomad, backpacks beat wheeled luggage any day. Best of travel backpacks are chosen based on specific user and quality.

There may be times breaking down and hoping your stuff magically packs itself is the best option. Unfortunately, there is no packing Merlin to save you. Don't worry, check out these lists and hopefully you'll breathe easier.\nWhile on the road, I've met several different types of travelers. There are some with nothing more than a 35L backpack and fanny pack for an entire year. There are others with a giant 120L wheeled hardshell, day pack, and fanny pack. Depending on your level of luxury, I will break down 3 lists: Ultralight Dirtbag, Moderately Modest, and the Luxurious Heavyweight.\nThe Ultimate Packing List does not include specific products and I am not an affiliate partner with any brands or stores. These are simple lists so you choose what products and brands work for you.\nUltralight Dirtbag You don’t mind wearing your underwear 4 different ways. If your shirts get a little tattered, that’s ok. You are also ok with finding items you may need along your travels as well as letting go of items easily. You do not become attached to things and possessions. If you need a book, you find one on the free rack in your hostel and leave it when you’re done. You are primarily traveling to warm to moderate climates thus don’t need much warm layers. You’re the kind of person who doesn’t care what others think based on what you wear (or smell like). You want your entire pack to be a carry on and skip checking a bag at all costs. You’re gambling with the idea that you’ll find some of your necessities along the way or the accommodation will have them such as a towel.    Moderately Modest You like to travel relatively light but you have your limits. You like having a little bit of versatility in your wardrobe but are ok with mismatching if it comes down to wearing clean clothes. You like rugged adventure but you also enjoy sitting out on a terrace people watching in a city or town. You have small attachments to possessions but if something were to happen to them, you can detach if need be. You like having entertainment such as books and movies but don’t need to bring a paperback or an entire computer when a simple tablet or eReader will suffice. You’re also traveling primarily in warm to moderate climates but are smart with your clothing options thus is easy to buy cheap layers if you do decide to go to cold climates. You take care of personal hygiene but don’t need to be extreme and shower every day. You’re ok with checking a bag and having a carry on day pack.    Luxurious/Adventurous Heavyweight You like your creature comforts or you are the rugged adventurer. You may enjoy looking fabulous and have a wardrobe to prove it. Or, you know you’re going to cold climates and more rigorous types of adventure thus need to carry more items. You’re smart with making your clothing versatile on style and use. You like don’t mind lugging around a heavier pack because you know you’re just going from one accommodation to the next. You enjoy staying in contact with friends and family back home and prefer using a computer. You also have your eReader because who wants to read a book on a computer? Or, you’re a digital nomad and need access to a computer at all times. You like your things and would prefer to hold on to them. If you are heading to more adventurous terrain, you prefer to use hiking boots opposed to cross-trainer shoes. When it comes to flying, you just barely make the 20-23kg checked bag requirement.    The Add-ons There are some items that you may want to consider but are not essential. Traveling long-term is a rare opportunity so items like a journal and camera might be considered essential for this trip, but you can survive without them. Here is a list of some other items to consider.    Final Thoughts and Notes You can mix and match or add items I didn’t even list. What it comes down to is “Do I need this or do I want this… when I am abroad?”. Other questions to ask yourself are, “Can I find this abroad?” and “am I willing to lug this around everywhere I go?”. You’ll out quickly if you overpacked after the first month abroad. Luckily, it’s easy to ship home or, better yet, give to someone in need. By the time you return from your trip, you’ll realize how unnecessary certain items you believed to be necessary truly are. You’ll also discover how much you can get by with and that you really don’t need much. It is liberating to downsize and its not only good for you but also the rest of the world.\nHave a favorite item missing from this list? Maybe a list you like instead? Shoot us an email! ","permalink":"http://nomadicmethod.com/ultimatelist/","tags":["Travel","Packing List","Guide","Recommendations"],"title":"Ultimate Travel Packing List"},{"categories":["Guides"],"contents":"The luxury of travel is becoming more available. Flights are getting cheaper, rideshare apps compete for your attention, and transportation alternatives are plentiful. With all the options, we tend to look at the price first and our impact second. Our choices do make a difference in what happens to the world. Whether it’s the local family you choose to help out or choosing sustainable travel alternatives, makes a difference for the bigger picture.\nOur planet is getting warmer. Doesn’t matter if you’re a denier shouting angry slogans, it’s a fact. It’s our decision on what to do about it. As nomads and travelers, we can make an impact based on our travel decisions. From choosing land transportation to helping a community install solar panels, every effort to reduce our carbon footprint not only helps the planet but also teaches by example. We can be indirect teachers if we choose to be. By you taking action helps other’s spark the motivation to make a difference.\nLet’s break down the 5 best options that continue to maximize your travel experience while reducing your impact on the world.\n1. Choose Land Travel over Flying Airplanes currently generate 11% of carbon emissions in the United States alone. At the current rate of growth, airplanes could generate 43 gigatonnes of pollution by 2050 consuming almost 5% of the world’s remaining carbon budget. The more people who choose to fly, the more planes there are. There’s prospect of fully electric airplanes already under production but until they reach commercial airways, pollution continues to climb — literally.  Choosing land transportation is a great option not only for the environment but also for your experience. Yes, it takes a bit longer to get from point A to point B but if you’re traveling for long-term, time is only relevant to your experience. The best experiences can come from those long-haul sleeper bus trips down Vietnam, the insane Indian Railways system, or even multi-day trips on the Trans Siberian Railroad. Some of my most memorable travel experiences stem from taking land transportation. Flying is convenient but long-haul land transport is unforgettable.\n   Riding the sleeper bus down Vietnam\n   Need to get over the ocean? No problem, take a freighter or a repositioning cruise! Yup, you read that right. You can charter a cabin on a freighter for about the same cost as a flight or less. The freighter can take up to a week or more but the serene ocean and tranquility of living on a boat can’t be matched by the inside of a cramped airplane cabin. Freighters not your thing? Repositioning cruises are cruise ships ending the season on one side of the hemisphere and relocating to begin another season on the other side. They offer one-way deals for up to half the cost if not more. Wine and dine in luxury while you travel the seven seas!  2. Rideshares and Carpooling Hitchhiking is taboo in America, however considered normal in certain parts of Europe and the rest of the world. I’m not suggesting sticking out a thumb and getting in the first car that puts by but there are reliable and safe ways to share a ride. BlaBlaCar in Europe, for example, is a great way to snag a ride and only pay your portion of gas. Build a profile and see what routes people are posting. You can view the driver’s profile and read a few reviews before making a decision, making the experience feel a bit safer. I’ve taken a 7 hour BlaBlaCar from Seville, Spain to Porto, Portugal with a monolingual Spaniard. I didn’t speak Spanish but we could still rock out to metal for 7 hours straight.  Other countries have their own alternatives. Whether it’s meeting other travelers in hostels or getting on craigslist in SE Asia, there are ways of finding rides not only cheaper but also reducing your impact by sharing a ride.  3. Volunteer Aborad There are several organizations abroad you can dedicate time to. You don’t have to be in the Peace Corps to devote time to helping those in need. Depending on what your skills and interests are, you can choose a wide variety of volunteer opportunities. Even if you’re not setting up solar panels or replanting forest groves, you’re making an impact on a community. Your efforts can be infectious. By offering your expertise and interests, you can help spread knowledge and impact our planet on a larger scale.  Organizations like Workaway.info offers travelers opportunities to work for room, board, and sometimes cash while on the road. Work experiences range from teaching english to kids to working on a permaculture farm. Wanna give more time to someone in need? There are several volunteer organizations to choose from, just find one that fits you best.  4. Stay Put Simple but probably one of the best pieces of advice I can give. Staying put offers some of the best experiences and possibilities of integrating with a foreign community vacationers will never be able to accomplish. By staying put, the air travel is put off, the bus ride canceled, and the train has left the station. You get the opportunity to be with another culture while reducing your footprint on the world. This is a no-brainer win-win situation.  5. Trek and Bikepack   Bikepacking the Annapurna Circuit\n   Maybe you’re more adventurous or want to become more adventurous. Now is a great time to get lost! Find a multi-day trek through the Himalayas, take a pilgrimage on the world renown Camino de Santiago, or bushwhack the island of Borneo. There are several opportunities waiting to be walked. Some of the most remote places can only be reached by foot. Finding an untouched piece of culture or nature adds a bit of ecstasy to the experience. Best of all, the only thing you leave behind are footprints.  In May of 2019 I met one of the most inspirational travelers while rock climbing the backside of the Batu Caves in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. A young french woman who traveled with her faithful bike for over 3 years throughout SE Asia. Her full load weighed around 50kg but she had everything she needed. When she needed to stop, she found a piece of property to pitch her tent or found gratitude from strangers who offered a floor to sleep on. She never paid for transportation and never paid to sleep. She only paid for food and experiences. Most of all, she didn’t skip over countries. She’s seen more of SE Asia than most SE Asians. By slowing down and riding from point to point, she truly experienced the countries and cultures she visited.  This list just the beginning. Let's hear from you! Have more suggestions?

Sometimes we end up choosing the brick and mortar bank down the street because we don’t want to make a decision. Having accounts that work in your favor while you’re abroad is important. There are banks that will make your life miserable while abroad and suck your money dry in ATM fees and foreign transaction fees. Being prepared before you travel is only going to help you down the road.\nFirst of all, you’ll need to have a checking account and a savings account. Prioritize these accounts accounts with your checking account as your primary, however your checking account is only a funnel for your other accounts. Think of it as the bottleneck for money going in and money going out. Secondary is your savings account. This is your ‘Do Not Touch’ account. This is what will be paying you when you’re abroad. Make sure you’re educated in your bank accounts. There are some accounts with overdraft fees thus if you’re not paying attention and you withdraw $1 over your account, there goes $30-$50 unnecessary dollars spent.\nThere are three ways of breaking down strategies for bank accounts. First, the Couch Potato method. This is for the person who really does not want to put time and effort into managing there accounts. Second, the Average Soul method. This is the person who wants to capitalize on high-yield accounts but doesn’t want to constantly have to shift and transfer money several times a month. Finally, the Maximizer method. This is the person who’s great at working systems to their advantage and does research on how to milk every last penny from banking institutions. Majority of us fall under the Average Soul method but lets break down each one.\nCouch Potato Method So you like your pizza bagels, that’s fine, just know there are better ways to save money just as there are better options for your diet. Pick your local brick and mortar bank that does not require monthly ‘service fees’. Service fees are ridiculous. I do have a strong opinion against the fat cat banks who are out to line their pockets with fees that are unnecessary. They are not your friend and instead of helping you, they’re trying to get you in some hidden fee when you signed away in blood. Ask around what your friends and family use. Do some research online. Even go and visit the local branch and tell them your shopping around but not ready to use them. Credit Unions are hit or miss but there are some good ones out there. For example, a local credit union in Portland, Oregon called Trailhead uses a great local credit union that has an impressive 3% yield checking account but she has to make “10 qualified debits each month” to activate the 3% yield as of summer of 2018.\n Average Soul Method Welcome to the masses. We like doing a little bit of research and maximizing our accounts but not to the extent of constantly moving money around. We need a checking and saving account but they don’t have to be down the street. We’re ok with utilizing the technology that’s now in our pockets to find the best rates. These days, online banking is the new normal. I have my favorites (which I’ll share below) but do your own research. Check out Bankrate and NerdWallet for checking and savings account reviews and what fits your needs. Be sure to have the mindset of living abroad when making your decision. Ask yourself, “will I be penalized if I withdraw from a foreign bank?” or “if I use my debit card, will there be a transaction fee?” To get started, I’ll point you to my favorites.\n Checking Account: Schwab Bank High Yield Investors Checking Account This is a 100% online checking account and has the best benefits for travelers. Yes, it’s intended for investors but that doesn’t mean you have to start watching the NASDAQ ticker. You do, however, have to begin by opening a brokerage account with Schwab. My current balance in my brokerage account is $0. I have never put money in my brokerage account. The only reason I have a Schwab brokerage account is so I can have the investors checking account. No strings or whistles here, just an empty open brokerage account. One last thing to note, if you receive paper checks, you can still deposit them through their ‘Deposit Check’ function on their app. All it does is take a photo of the front and back of your checks with your signature and poof, it’s in your account in about 3-4 business days. Here are some key benefits to the High Yield Investors Checking Account:\n  $0 monthly fee $0 minimum balance .15% APY $0 foreign transaction fees Unlimited ATM rebates at the end of the month  Did you catch those last two? You want to hold on to your money, not let the middle man cut your purse. You will use an ATM often abroad. Sometimes banks state they have $0 foreign transaction fees and unlimited ATM withdrawals but they forget to tell you about the foreign bank you are withdrawing from that is charging you to use their ATM or that Visa will charge the foreign transaction fee. Schwab has truly $0 foreign transaction including the Visa transaction fee and rebates all of the ATM fees at the end of the month, including the foreign bank. While in Europe, it was normal for a 5 Euro transaction fee for every ATM withdrawal. On top of that, if I used Wells Fargo or Bank of America, they have a 3% foreign transaction fee. For me to take out $100 at an ATM in Europe, I end up losing $8.60 every time I use an ATM. Not only does the Investors High-Yield Checking Account have a $0 ATM fee, it rebates all the transaction fees from foreign banks at the end of the month. The main flaw to the High Yield Investors Checking account is their app. It’s clunky, hard to find necessary tools such as bank transfers, and it has a lot of jargon that is intended for investors. Maybe they’ll have a better UX design later but for now, I’m willing to clunk around with them while abroad\n Savings Account: Ally Online Savings Account Ally Online Savings Account was rated Best Online Bank in 2018 by Money Magazine for good reason. It is a fairly easy platform with no hidden fees. They do have fees but they are upfront about it on their signup page in bold. Just don’t do a bank transfer more than 6 times (who does that anyways?). The main reason for having a savings account is not to touch it, remember? Just put money in it and watch it grow. That’s why I chose Ally, it’s a straightforward account with an high APY. Here are some key benefits to Ally Online Savings:\n  1.6% APY No monthly fees or minimum balance required Connect any external bank with no transaction fees in or out (unless you’re using the Federal Reserve Wire Network. Don’t do that.)  That’s it because that’s all you really need. When this account is full and your abroad, flip the switch and have it start paying you instead of you paying it.\n Accounts to Note: Simple Online Bank I love Simple Online bank. I never knew a man could fall in such a deep love with a bank account until I met Simple. Simple is a great checking account for keeping you on track. It’s another 100% online account but it differs from the rest. It’s called ‘Simple’ for a reason, it’s all about the app and how it relates to your account. Simple offers an envelope system and ‘Safe-to-spend’ feature. You just set up a goal like ‘Rent’ and Simple will either automatically fill it when a paycheck is deposited or fill it over time based on your criteria. When you set up an envelope for each of your expenditures, Simple will tell you how much you have that is ‘Safe-to-spend’ instead of how much you have in your account. They also have the best customer service I have seen out of any tech platform. That’s right Amazon, Simple wins. Their tech support is mainly through the app with just a texting based system. When I used them before traveling, I remember needing help with a check that wasn’t depositing in time and after they helped resolve the issue, the customer service agent sent me a long drawn out gif of a gladiator fighting a lion. It had nothing to do with our conversation yet it had everything to do keeping our conversation between humans. Here are some key features to Simple Online Bank:\n  1.75-1.90% APY (with a checking account?!) Goals and ‘Safe-to-Spend’ feature Trackable spending No minimum deposit to open No monthly service fee ATM Map  The only reason I use Schwab High Yield Investors Checking over Simple is because of the Unlimited ATM withdraw feature and $0 foreign transaction fees. Although Simple states they have $0 transaction fee for a non-BBVA ATM, you can still get charged by the foreign bank, just not Simple. Simple also states they do not charge a foreign transaction fee, however Visa does.\n Capital One 360 Savings Account If you feel safer going with a name you know, I recommend Capital One 360 Savings Account. Capital One is one of the big financial institutions but their online savings account is straight-forward, which again, is all you need. It’s great for a beginner savings account in that totes being ‘fee-free’. It’s app is fairly intuitive but you can get he same from Ally. Here are some key features to Capital One 360 Savings Account:  1.7% APY No monthly fees $0 minimum balance  That’s pretty much it. Again, the only reason to choose this is because you feel safe using a recognizable name. Time to put emotional connections aside and start using logic when choosing accounts to work for you instead of against you.\n Maximizer Method You love numbers, you love spreadsheets, you love capitalizing, and you love schedules. You’re a Maximizer. You have done a lot of research not only on which checking and savings accounts to open but also fund accounts like CD funds and Money Market accounts. You’ve figured out your funnel system that diverts money not just to your bills and savings but also to your investment funds and back to your savings account. You have an aggressive financial advisor and willing to take investment risks. If you choose to be a maximizer, I recommend working with a financial advisor who can recommend investment funds and help you set up your accounts to work best for you. Some financial advisors require a fee and some work for a financial institution and don’t cost you a dime. Just know the financial institution advisors will try and steer you towards their companies investments. There’s nothing wrong with that, just don’t be hasty and do your own research. I have a financial advisor with Waddell and Reed and he’s done wonders for helping me reach my travel goals. Yes, he helped me set up a retirement account with Waddell and Reed and my return fund is a very low risk mutual fund portfolio thus I felt safe opening these funds. In 2010, my financial advisor helped set up an insanely small portfolio of only $2,000. I forgot about it until I came back from traveling. Now grateful I invested the pennies, I can live comfortably for 4 months while I figure out the next revenue stream. The masses would say that’s a pretty good deal but a Maximizer would consider it lazy and that I could have funded several years if I only managed the funds aggressively. If this is you, awesome, crunch those numbers and reap the benefits.\n What's Next? Once you’ve made your decision, it’s time to start forecasting and automating.
